          Video feedback occurs when you have a camera pointed at a screen, and
          the camera is feeding into the screen. You can get some really
          interesting effects by doing this.

          None of that video above was generated using a computer. It's due to a
          variety of effects, including the fact that there's latency between
          the video capture and the display of the image. The two chase each
          other. I got the idea to try simulating video feedback after seeing a
          demo of this not too long ago, and that's my project -- a video
          feedback simulator.
        </p>

      <div id="process">
        <h1>The Process</h1>
        <p>
          To achieve a video feedback effect, I already had a general idea of
          what I needed to do -- things such as rotating the image and zooming
          in or out help to create those discrepancies between the video capture
          and display. I also thought it would be beneficial to add other
          things, such as blurring and sharpening, to try to replicate some of
          the effects from using analog mediums instead of purely simulated
          ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, to start things off, I essentially took a lot of the code form
          older projects in the course and had various effects in a loop, hoping
          to generate a series of frames modifying a base image of generated
          noise. Unfortunately, it turns out this was a pretty inefficient
          process for a few reasons, one of the biggest ones being performance.
          It took a long time to get enough frames to get an idea of what was
          going on, and actually editing the process was tedious. To solve this,
          I ended up rewriting the code to use OpenImageIO's libraries more
          heavily, which gave access to a lot of optimizations, including
          multithreading. At the same time, I reworked the pipeline -- now, I
          had all the manipulation functions defined, and using Boost's Program
          Options library, I set things up so that they would run based on a
          series of command line options. With this, it was possible to edit the
          order of effects just by rerunning the program, and it was a lot
          simpler to add more options to the program. To make results
          reproducible while testing, I also added a seed flag you could use to
          seed the random generator. As of now, there's options to edit the
          dimensions, output directory, frame limit, and seed for basic
          parameterse on every run. The options I have for manipulations are
          applying a gaussian blur where you specify the kernel size, sharpening
          the image using an unsharpen mask, adding noise to each frame,
          rotating the camera, zooming the camera, blending the previous frame
          into the current one, and something called crawl. I got the idea for
          the crawl effect from http://erleuchtet.org/2011/06/white-one.html, a
          neat project I found while researching video feedback simulation.
          Using the HSV color space, each pixel is essentially given a marching
          value, and it grabs its new color from a space in that direction and
          distance. It doesn't have a real world comparison, but it creates some
          really interesting effects.

        <p>
          There's a big reason I ended up adding more than just zooming and
          rotating -- it's hard to keep a feedback loop going; they tend to
          trend towards a stable state, which often means the screen goes blank.

          One of the things you do to prevent this is occasionally or
          continually add new artifacts into the feedback loop. In real life you
          might do this by temporarily changing display settings, shaking the
          camera, or moving an object between the camera and screen. A rather
          effective way to keep things going digitally, however, is simply
          adding noise every frame (which is also present in some real life
          feedback setups, due to limitations and imperfections in hardware and
          the environment). This next video uses only a small zoom factor and
          noise varying from -0.3-0.3 variance to generate the effects shown.

        <p>
          Results can vary a great deal based on the inputs and order of them;
          this video was made by combining most of the options.

          And of course, one of my favorite effects was adding the crawl. It
          took a while to get this working right, but this effect goes a decent
          way towards keeping a simulation from stopping out as well as
          generating a lot of different effects. The HSV crawling leads to some
          more dynamic visualizations.

        <h1>Future Improvements</h1>
        <p>
          In the future, I'd like to work on adding more features; there's a lot
          of possible effects. Some things off the top of my head are other
          methods of blending, some form of histogram equalization to prevent
          simulations from getting too bright or too dark, and more options for
          noise. Some other neat features would be randomly generated runs and
          the ability to use manipulations more than once in a simulation
          pipeline. I'm also interested in rewriting the code so that it's GPU
          accelerated; I think ideally I get the manipulations running as GLSL
          shaders -- then I'd be able to even embed this in a webpage using
          WebGL, which would make it a lot easier to add interactive controls.
          Along with this, I believe this would make it easier to have an
          interactive pipeline that you can edit while it runs.

            -- There's a lot about simulating video feedback here using a
            program called Visions of Chaos (it simulates a lot of other stuff,
            too). This is where I got the ideas for trying a lot of these
            effects. I actually toyed around with the software for a bit to get
            an idea of what I should be trying to achieve; I've got no clue how
            the stuff works behind the scenes, but the interface is what gave me
            the idea for using a dynamic pipeline for transformations.
